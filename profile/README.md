# URBREATH

## Project Overview

**URBREATH** is a Horizon Europe project focusing on boosting **social interactions, inclusion, equitability, and liveability** in cities. The project aims to put **communities at the heart of decision-making** for regional and local sustainable development.

To achieve this, the project team will develop, implement, demonstrate, validate, and replicate a comprehensive, **community participation and Nature-Based Solution (NBS)-driven paradigm** within the spectrum of urban revitalization, resilience, and climate neutrality. These methodological approaches will be enhanced via **social innovation practices, digital twins, and artificial intelligence tools**.

## What We Do

URBREATH is about reimagining urban living, where concrete jungles give way to lush green havens. By weaving nature into the fabric of our cities – from expansive green roofs to vibrant urban forests and thriving wetlands – we aim to:

* Combat the urban heat island effect
* Mitigate flood risks
* Purify our air

## What We Aim For

We aim to transform our cities from the ground up, making them not only **sustainable** but also **resilient** against the ever-growing threats of a warming world.

## Our Expectations

Our goal is to make our cities more **livable and inclusive** and to establish a **model for urban areas** to play a central role in addressing climate change, transforming our vulnerability into a powerful defense.
